# What I Learned

Starting SQL for the very first time through the Luke Barousse course while also being part of the DEPI program has been a game-changer for me. This project wasnâ€™t just about writing queriesâ€”it was about building my foundation as a data analyst step by step:

- **First Steps in SQL:** Learned how to structure queries, filter data with WHERE, and connect multiple tablesâ€”things that once looked intimidating now feel like natural tools.

 - **Data Exploration Mindset:** Discovered how SQL isnâ€™t just about coding, but about asking the right questions and translating them into queries that uncover insights.

 - **Hands-On Experience:** Through real-world job market data, I got to practice using SQL for meaningful analysis, not just toy examples.

- **Building Confidence:** Moving from zero SQL knowledge to being able to craft queries with JOINs, GROUP BY, and even CTEs showed me how much progress I can make when learning by doing.

This first project gave me the confidence that SQL isnâ€™t just a technical skillâ€”itâ€™s a powerful lens for answering business questions and uncovering opportunities.

# Insights

The analysis revealed several key takeaways about the data analyst job market:

**1.Highest-Paying Roles:** Remote data analyst positions can reach impressive salaries, with the top offers climbing up to $650K.

**2.Skills Behind Top Salaries:** SQL consistently appears in high-paying job postings, proving its importance for analysts aiming at top-tier compensation.

**3.Most Requested Skills:** Employers prioritize SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau, and Power BI, cementing them as the core toolkit for analysts.

**4.Premium Skills for Salary Growth:** Advanced and niche tools like PySpark, Solidity, and cloud platforms drive salaries higher, highlighting the value of specialization.

**5.Best Skills for Market Competitiveness:** SQL stands out as the most strategic skillâ€”high in demand and well-compensatedâ€”making it a cornerstone for maximizing career opportunities.

# Closing Thoughts

This project gave me my first real experience applying SQL to explore the data analyst job market.
